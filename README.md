# Natural Speech Decoding - Word classification
Project during INM-ICS hackathon.

## Problem
Can we predict individual words from EEG, when people are passively listening
to audio.

## The data
We are using the natural speech data set from:
https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.070jc
This included data from 19 participants each having about data from 20 runs of
about 3 mins recordings.
Then there is the data of a 128Hz audio envelope and words and their respective
onsets.
